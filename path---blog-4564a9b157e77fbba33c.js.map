This abstraction allowed developers to focus on writing domain code without worrying about locking, staleness, or even on what core/machine the process was located. A cluster can be similarly abstracted. This allows developers to worry less about networking, load balancing, and service discovery, and more about solving domain problems at scale. </p>\\n<p>I've been thinking hard about what such an abstraction would look like, and <em>think</em> I have something which could work. Obviously this is all subject to change, and a lot of hard work will need to be done to make it a reality (failure detection, gossiping, sharding, membership and so on) but I'd be very happy if Nact

I decided to take a more localised, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation\\\">lazy</a> approach to read models, because I feel that this is truer to what Nact is about (small, simple, functional). The global model is still useful in many instances, but it is quite a prescriptive approach and can anyway be modeled using the primitives Nact offers. </p>\\n<p>As the documentation explains:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Nact provides the persistent query feature as a light-weight (but powerful) form of CQRS. A persistent query takes in a persistent key, and returns a function which when invoked replays the persisted events, building a result which is finally returned as a promise. A persistent query is lazy in that it only retrieves events when forced. It may be invoked any number of times, each time checking for new events. The result and sequence number of the query are cached with an optional timeout, and the result may optionally also be snapshotted every given number of messages. </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The rest of the documentation for persistence queries in js and reason can be found <a href=\\\"/lesson/javascript/persistent-queries/\\\">here</a> and <a href=\\\"/lesson/reasonml/persistent-queries/\\\">here</a>.</p>\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"timeToRead\": 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"excerpt\": \"Version 7.1.0 of NactJS and version 4.1.0 of ReasonNact added a new feature, Persistent Queries, which should go some way to supporting...\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"frontmatter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Persistent Queries\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"cover\": \"https://unsplash.it/400/300/?random?BoldMage\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"date\": \"2018-05-19\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"category\": \"tech\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"tags\": []\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"fields\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"slug\": \"/persistent-queries\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"pathContext\": {}\n\t};\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---blog-4564a9b157e77fbba33c.js","module.exports = {\n\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\"allMarkdownRemark\": {\n\t\t\t\"edges\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"node\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"html\": \"<p>Midway through 2017, I was due to start a job at <a href=\\\"https://root.co.za\\\">Root</a>.

This abstraction allowed developers to focus on writing domain code without worrying about locking, staleness, or even on what core/machine the process was located. A cluster can be similarly abstracted. This allows developers to worry less about networking, load balancing, and service discovery, and more about solving domain problems at scale. </p>\\n<p>I've been thinking hard about what such an abstraction would look like, and <em>think</em> I have something which could work. Obviously this is all subject to change, and a lot of hard work will need to be done to make it a reality (failure detection, gossiping, sharding, membership and so on) but I'd be very happy if Nact clustering could look something like this:</p>\\n<p>This is the ReasonML version:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-reason\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token

I decided to take a more localised, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation\\\">lazy</a> approach to read models, because I feel that this is truer to what Nact is about (small, simple, functional). The global model is still useful in many instances, but it is quite a prescriptive approach and can anyway be modeled using the primitives Nact offers. </p>\\n<p>As the documentation explains:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Nact provides the persistent query feature as a light-weight (but powerful) form of CQRS. A persistent query takes in a persistent key, and returns a function which when invoked replays the persisted events, building a result which is finally returned as a promise. A persistent query is lazy in that it only retrieves events when forced. It may be invoked any number of times, each time checking for new events. The result and sequence number of the query are cached with an optional timeout, and the result may optionally also be snapshotted every given number of messages. </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The rest of the documentation for persistence queries in js and reason can be found <a href=\\\"/lesson/javascript/persistent-queries/\\\">here</a> and <a href=\\\"/lesson/reasonml/persistent-queries/\\\">here</a>.</p>\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"timeToRead\": 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"excerpt\": \"Version 7.1.0 of NactJS and version 4.1.0 of ReasonNact added a new feature, Persistent Queries, which should go some way to supporting...\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"frontmatter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Persistent Queries\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"cover\": \"https://unsplash.it/400/300/?random?BoldMage\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"date\": \"2018-05-19\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"category\": \"tech\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"tags\": []\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"fields\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"slug\": \"/persistent-queries\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\t\"pathContext\": {}\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/blog.json\n// module id = 372\n// module chunks = 49683490770531"],"sourceRoot":""}
